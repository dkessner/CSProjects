Hello CS Projects coders!

This class is for you to explore new areas of computer science, and to work on
projects that are interesting to you.

Some ideas:

- video projections for the All School Dance Concert, in collaboration with our
  student dancers and choreographers

- special effects for the theater productions

- interactive data visualization in collaboration with the UltraViolet

- anything else you're interested in!


I'm looking forward to seeing what you create this year!


Dr. Kessner
