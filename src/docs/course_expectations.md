# Course Expectations

## Assignments and Grading

Your grade will be based on managing your software projects, and delivering
them on time.  You might have multiple (or even simultaneous) projects.

You will present your project(s) regularly at Show & Tell.  You will also
document your progress in your Project Log.  At each checkpoint (Show & Tell +
Project Log update) you will have a set of grades based on the class learning
targets.

## Weekly schedule

Most of the class periods will be dedicated time for your projects.

I will give short demos periodically.  Let me know if there is something in
particular you want to see.

You will be presenting at Show & Tell every 3 weeks, the last class of the week.

If you're involved in a production (e.g. the All School Dance Concert) you will
likely need to spend extra time outside of class.  During those times, please
feel free to use class time as you need it.

## Resources

All software and/or other learning materials for the course will be free and
open source.

## Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Recent advances in AI have resulted in great improvements in AI-based code
generation.  Generated code may be correct, but also may have subtle bugs.
Remember that your goal in this course is for __you__ to improve your coding
skills.  

If you feel that AI will help your project, you are welcome to use it, subject
to the following:

- You must fully document any use of AI code generation in your project.  You
  may not take credit for code that you did not write.

- You are responsible for getting your program to run, including debugging all
  issues.  Remember that debugging your own code is difficult enough; debugging
  AI-generated code can be even more difficult.

- Prefer open source, locally installed AI to 3rd party web services.
  If you do use a 3rd party web service:
    - Be sure not to submit any identifying information
    - Abide by the service's license agreement
    - Abide by Marlborough's Student Technology Responsible Use Policy
