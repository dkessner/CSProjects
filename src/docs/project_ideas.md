# Project ideas

## Video Projections / Special Effects

You will have the opportunity to work with dancers/choreographers to create
video projections for the All School Dance Concert (Processing or p5.js).

We will also be working with the theater productions to create special effects
to be used during the performances.

## Past Projects - Visual Novels / Narrative Video Games

If you are interested in learning web development (HTML/CSS/Javascript),
you could also work on web-based visual novels.

These projects use the 
[Monogatari](https://monogatari.io/) 
[visual novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) engine.
I used this engine to make
[Alice's Adventures](https://dkessner.github.io/alice/),
a project for my niece Alice.
