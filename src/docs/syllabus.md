## Course Description

This course is for students who would like to continue their study of computer
science beyond AP Computer Science A, and to apply the skills they learned in
that course. The class provides a workshop / lab environment for students to
work independently on individual or group projects, to improve their coding
skills, and to explore and tinker with new technologies. Students have freedom
to pick their own projects, and are encouraged to try things they have never
done before. They may choose any area of computer science, including but not
limited to: computer graphics, video games, virtual reality, mini-computers /
microcontrollers (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino), physical / wearable computing,
interactive art, simulation, data analysis, scientific applications,
programming languages, web development, mobile development. Students may enroll
in this class multiple times for credit. 

## Learning Targets 

### Discipline-Specific Conceptual Knowledge

Learning the principles of software design and complexity management. Learning
how to debug, handle errors, and validate software through testing.

- skills (depends on project)
    - language / target platform (e.g. Javascript for web pages,
      Processing for video games, Python for data analysis)
    - domain-specific techniques (e.g. 3D graphics effects,
      exploratory data analysis)
- practice:
    - implementation of features on their project(s)
- assessment:
    - regularly scheduled code reviews
    - final presentation / performance


### Communication & Dissemination

Participating in code reviews, in which they present their projects to their
classmates, communicate problems and solutions, and learn to give and
incorporate feedback.

- skills:
    - presenting technical knowledge in an understandable way
    - communicating the high-level design of a project
    - explaining problems and potential solutions
- practice:
    - presenting project at code reviews
- assessment:
    - regularly scheduled code reviews
    - final presentation / performance


## Collaboration

Working on projects with classmates, and also collaborate with students in
other fields (e.g. social sciences, community partnerships, performing and
visual arts, scientific research)

- skills:
    - collaborating with classmates on coding assignments or projects
    - communicating details about problems or errors
    - describing advantages or disadvantages of potential
      implementations
- practice:
    - working together on coding assignments
    - group software projects
- assessment:
    - regularly scheduled code reviews
    - final presentation / performance


## Agency, Leadership & Professionalism

Managing projects by tracking progress on features and bugs, and
prioritizing and scheduling coding tasks.

- skills:
    - tracking and making regular progress on software projects
    - communicating progress and anticipating roadblocks
    - responding to feedback from clients or other collaborators
    - delivering software project on time
- practice:
    - work on long-term software projects
- assessment:
    - regularly scheduled code reviews
    - final presentation / performance


## Design Process

Using design thinking to model and break down problems. Learning to
create and implement useful abstractions, and prototype and evaluate
solutions.

- skills:
    - research and prototyping
    - controlling code complexity through the use of language features
      (e.g. functions and classes) and design patterns
    - evaluating potential implementations
- practice:
    - long-term software projects
- assessment:
    - regularly scheduled code reviews
    - final presentation / performance
