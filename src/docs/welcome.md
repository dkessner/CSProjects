# Welcome to CS Projects!


Hello CS Projects coders!

This class is for you to explore new areas of computer science, and to work on
projects that are interesting to you.

Some opportunities we will have this year:

- video projections for the All School Dance Concert, in collaboration with our
  student dancers and choreographers

- special effects for the theater productions

- interactive US election 2024 map

- anything else you're interested in!


I'm looking forward to seeing what you create this year!
