Students have freedom to pick their own projects, and are encouraged to try things they have never done before. They may choose any area of computer science, including but not limited to: computer graphics, video games, virtual reality, mini-computers / microcontrollers (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino), physical / wearable computing, interactive art, simulation, data analysis, scientific applications, programming languages, web development, mobile development.
